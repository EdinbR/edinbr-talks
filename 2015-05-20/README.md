Talks at this meeting were:

## Introduction to R-Shiny (Alastair Kerr)

Shiny is a package from RStudio that makes it incredibly easy to build interactive web applications with R (http://rstudio.github.io/shiny/tutorial/). In this talk I will introduce the basics of the R-shiny package and server and demonstrate how a few lines of code can get a fully functional app for data exploration. I'll show examples where it has been very useful in our Bioinformatics Core Facility for creating interactive tables and figures for our users

## Interactive charts in R (Ben Moore)

I’ll show some examples of how you can create interactive javascript plots in R without any js knowledge using the rCharts package as well as newer spin-out packages like leaflet and rcdimple. I’ll talk about the growing trend of gluing together R and web libraries using htmlwidgets, and even more broadly how online interlanguage function repositories can be accessed from R.
