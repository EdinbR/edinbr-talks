Talks at this meeting were:


## Introduction to Reproducible Research in R and R Studio (Susan Johnston)
Conducting reproducible and transparent research is not only good scientific practise, it also makes life much easier. R and the RStudio environment contain a number of useful tools for producing reproducible research, from dynamic report writing in R markdown and knitr, to integrated version control of data and analyses using git. I'll present a quick-start guide on the basics that RStudio has to offer for reproducible research, aimed at all levels of R expertise.

## Interfacing C with R (Jarrod Hadfield)

Pure R code is fast to develop but can be very slow to run. Many R functions therefore call lower level languages such as C. I'll give a worked example of how to do this: and hopefully persuade people its not too difficult and often worth the extra effort.
