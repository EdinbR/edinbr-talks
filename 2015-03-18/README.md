Talks at this meeting were:


## Intro to ggplot2 (Christophe Ladroue)
ggplot2 is a very popular R package for statistical graphics and it's probably going to be discussed often in future R meetings. But more importantly it's a very useful package to know and I'll give a brief (15min) introduction to how it works: its basic syntax and a few examples, as well as a couple of tricks. The aim is to get you up to speed if you don't know anything or very little about ggplot2.

## How (not to) submit a project to CRAN (David C. Sterratt)

The comprehensive R archive network (CRAN) is tremendous boon for R users, allowing easy installation of R software packages written by others. Getting your package onto CRAN is a great way of sharing and archiving your code. The CRAN maintainers do a fantastic job of making sure that packages compile on all platforms, that the code and documentation passes checks, that licences are sound and the package descriptions are adequate. However, with over 6000 packages on CRAN, they are busy people and don't have time to help novices with the sometimes fiddly process of getting packages ready for CRAN and submitting them. I'll outline how to submit your package to CRAN and, based on my mistakes, how not to.
