## A digression about `warnings`

`warn.R`

# The debugger

## A brief refresher on quick sort

- a classic sorting algorithm
- basic idea: split the values to be sorted into two sets such that the values in the first set are all less than those in the second set. Iterate.

## The debugger in practice

`quicksort.R`

## Summary
- `warn`:
    - 0 (default): show the warnings in bulk
    - 1: show the warnings as they happen
    - 2: convert warnings to errors
- the debugger
    - in `RStudio`: add / remove breakpoints by clicking on the left hand side of the line numbers.
    - in `R`: call `browser()`. Useful for conditional breakpoints. Don't forget to remove when your code is ready.
    - in `RStudio`: possibility to break into code when an error occurs.
